1. The world wide Covid-19 Pandemic Data-Set really peaked my interest. It has the world wide Covid-19 information. It has highly detailed information as well such as number of people who died and number of people who recovered. This is very useful information for anyone around the world since the pandemic affected everyone. You can make some great insights from this data on what some countries did to protect themselves against the virus and what some countries did to worsen their situation. You can save lives with this information for any future pandamic. Here is the link: https://github.com/datasets/covid-19


2. The book that I looked into was the Intro to R and its application in Data Analysis. I used R in my undergrad degree quite a bit but have not used it since I know it is a powerful tool and I know we are also going to be working with R in this class. Here is the book: Introduction to R - Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics - W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team
